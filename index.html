                    <b>The Great Rain</b><br>
                    It was going to rain. The weather forecast didn't say that, 
                    but the steel plate in his hip did. He had learned over the 
                    years to trust his hip over the weatherman. It was going 
                    to rain, so he better get outside and prepare.

                    <b>Hesitation</b><br>
                    He heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away. 
                    His heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint. 
                    "It wasn't a gunshot, it wasn't a gunshot," he repeated under 
                    his breathlessness as he continued to sprint.

                    <b>A Good Day</b><br>
                    She wanted rainbow hair. That's what she told the hairdresser. 
                    It should be deep rainbow colors, too. She wasn't interested 
                    in pastel rainbow hair. She wanted it deep and vibrant so there 
                    was no doubt that she had done this on purpose.

                    <b>The Decision</b><br>
                    Cake or pie? I can tell a lot about you by which one you pick. 
                    It may seem silly, but cake people and pie people are really different. 
                    I know which one I hope you are, but that's not for me to decide. 
                    So, what is it? Cake or pie?

                    <b>Leather Scars</b><br>
                    The leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years. 
                    It wore those scars with pride, feeling that they enhanced his presence 
                    rather than diminishing it. The scars gave it character and had not 
                    overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty. The jacket was in 
                    its prime and it knew it.

                    <b>Teenage Years</b><br>
                    Do you really listen when you are talking with someone? I 
                    have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way. She actually 
                    takes every word you say as being something important and when 
                    you have a friend that listens like that, words take on a 
                    whole new meaning.
